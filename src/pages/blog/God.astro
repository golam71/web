:question: **ALLAH**
:mosque:

In the Name of Allah, the Most Merciful and Most Compassionate.

Nowadays, as Islam begins to spread throughout the world, many people hear the word "Allah" and understand it to be the God which Muslims refer to. Many people think that Allah is a separate deity, or try to assert it.

### The Word "Allah"

We believe the God (al-ilāh, the God) or Allah, is the true deity of worship, and there are no equals of Him. We prefer saying Allah because the word “God” in English is misleading and can refer to any object of worship, the word for that in Arabic is 'ilah'. The word Allah makes it clear that we are referring to the One (wāhid) the Creator (khāliq) of the Universe and all that is in it, and the Master of all people.



### Allah's Oneness

:arrow_right: **Allah says:** 
*"Do not argue with the People of the Book except gracefully, except with those of them who act wrongfully. And say, 'We believe in what has been revealed to us and what was revealed to you. Our God and your God is ˹only˺ One. And to Him we ˹fully˺ submit."* [29:46]

*Note: The phrase "People of the Book" refers to the Jews & Christians.*

We believe that the God of the Muslims is the same as the God of the Jews and Christians; however there might be differences in what the other groups may attribute towards Him and His Nature.

In fact, you can in the Gideon's Bible—which is one of the most popularly distributed Bibles and also which can be found in almost any hotel in the United States—find the mention of the word "Allah"! A verity which many may not know, even if they might own multiple of them or may have seen or read through much of them.

## Understanding Tawhid

### :point_up: MONOTHEISM - T-A-W-H-I-D

*In the name of Allah, the Most Merciful and Most Compassionate.*

In this segment we will discuss the most essential part and/or constituent of Islamic theology, which is **Tawhid**. Many hear this word, but some do not make effort to delve into it. For the sake of understanding, we will divide it into categories.

### Tawhid Defined

:point_right: **Tawhid**, if translated in context, means: **Oneness (of God)**

**Tawhid can be divided into 3 different categories:**

1. :muscle: **Tawhīd Ar-Rubbūbiyyah (Lordship)**
   is ‘to single out Allah alone with His actions and ownership.'

2. :pray: **Tawhīd al-ulūhiyyah (worship)**
   is 'to single out Allah alone with all acts of worship.'

3. :name_badge: **Tawhīd al-asma' wa as-sifaat (names and attributes)**
   is 'to affirm and single out Allah alone with what He has named Himself with or described Himself with in His Book or upon the tongue of His Messenger (:point_up:1SAW~1:)'.

### Tawhīd Ar-Rubbūbiyyah

These Verses talk about His Lordship and describe some crucial parts of Tawhī al-Rubūbiyyah.

**"Allah - There is no god ˹worthy of worship˺ except Him, the Ever-Living, All-Sustaining. Neither drowsiness nor sleep overtakes Him. To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth. Who could possibly intercede with Him without His permission? He ˹fully˺ knows what is ahead of them and what is behind them, but no one can grasp any of His knowledge—except what He wills ˹to reveal˺. His Seat¹ encompasses the heavens and the earth, and the preservation of both does not tire Him. For He is the Most High, the Greatest."**

### Tawhīd al-ulūhiyyah

:point_right: **Tawhid al-Ulūhiyyah** is one of the most important characteristics of Islamic monotheism. It is the singling out of any, and all deities besides Allah in worship & affirmation that there is none worthy of worship except Allah.

**Allah says [to Moses (pbuh) in the Sacred Valley of Tuwa]:**
*"‘It is I. I am Allah! There is no god  ˹worthy of worship˺ except Me. So worship Me ˹alone˺, and establish prayer for My remembrance."* [20:14]

*Had it been Allah’s Will to have offspring, He could have chosen whatever He willed of His creation. Glory be to Him! He is Allah—the One, the Supreme.*
[39:4]

### Tawhid al-Asmā was-Sifāt

**Tawhid al-Asmā was-Sifāt** is to describe Allah & naming him with whatever he described and named himself with, and with whatever his Messenger (:point_up:1SAW~1:) described and named him with in the authentic narrations, and to affirm that for Allah without resemblance to the creation, and without false interpretation of any of that or negation.

**Allah says:**
*"There is nothing like Him, for He ˹alone˺ is the All-Hearing, All-Seeing."* [42:11]

He ( :point_up:1SWT~1: ) also says:
*"Allah has the Most Beautiful Names. So call upon Him by them, and keep away from those who abuse His Names. They will be punished for what they used to do."* [7:180]

It is obligatory upon the servant to withhold and remain silent about that which Allah and the Messenger (:point_up:1SAW~1:) withheld from mentioning―and to restrict themselves to the speech of Allah and to the speech of His Messenger (:point_up:1SAW~1:) and to have certain-belief in everything that is affirmed in the Revealed texts regarding the Names and Attributes of Allah. And likewise one must negate from Allah whatever Allah has negated from Himself or what the Messenger (:point_up:1SAW~1:) negated from Him of deficiencies and inadequacies.

So the Names and Attributes of Allah should be accepted and affirmed without inquiring 'how' about their exact nature. Believing in their apparent meaning is an obligation and contemplation about the nature of these attributes is not allowed, and the Messenger of Allah (:point_up:1SAW~1:) said:
*“Reflect upon the creation and do not reflect upon Allah."* [Silsilaat as-Saheehah 1788]

**Allah ( :point_up:1SWT~1: ) has 99 names and attributes** which we should learn, understand, memorize and internalize.

:warning: **EPILOGUE**

To conclude, let's take a look at a Verse which was previously mentioned here which combines all these three categorizations of Tawhid.

**Allah ( :point_up:1SWT~1: ) says:** 
*Allah! There is no god ˹worthy of worship˺ except Him (Tawhīd al Ulūhiyyah), the Ever-Living, All-Sustaining (Tawhid al-Asmā was-Sifāt). Neither drowsiness nor sleep overtakes Him. To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and what is on the earth. Who could possibly intercede with Him without His permission? He ˹fully˺ knows what is ahead of them and what is behind them, but no one can grasp any of His knowledge—except what He wills ˹to reveal˺. His Kursi encompasses the heavens and the earth, and the preservation of both does not tire Him. (Tawhīd al-Rubūbiyyah). For He is the Most High, the Greatest. (Tawhid al-Asmā was-Sifāt) [2:255]

Any & all good in this is from Allah, and any & all mistakes are from me. I pray for forgiveness for any mistakes which may lead to misguidance & error and guidance for everyone who reads it. May Allah bestow upon us knowledge, righteousness & wisdom.

All praise is due to the Lord of all Creation & the Universe. And peace and blessings be upon the Messenger (:point_up:1SAW~1:) who He has sent in Truth.
